### Chapter 6: Combat

Combat in Gen6 is designed to be fast-paced and thrilling, reflecting the pulpy style of the game. It can be deadly, so strategic thinking and quick actions are crucial. Your defense represents a combination of dodging, parrying, and blocking. When you get hit, there are no "soak" rolls to mitigate damage; you take it directly. However, the game is balanced to allow for heroic feats and exciting action.

## Step-by-Step Combat

### 1. Determine Surprise
Before combat begins, determine if any side is surprised. Surprised characters cannot act in the first round.

### 2. Establish Positions
Place characters and enemies on the battlefield. Establishing positions helps clarify movement and line of sight.

### 3. Roll Initiative
Initiative in Gen6 uses side initiative. Starting to the left of the Game Master (GM), a player rolls for their side, and the GM rolls for the enemies. The next time an initiative roll is needed, it goes to the next player to the left. Turns alternate between sides, going clockwise around the table.

### 4. Take Turns
Players and enemies take turns based on the initiative order. Each turn, a character can perform actions such as moving, attacking, or using items.

### 5. Next Round
Once all characters have taken their turns, a new round begins. Repeat the process until the combat ends.

## Damage and Healing

Your health pool represents your overall health. When you take damage, you may suffer wounds based on the severity of the damage.

| Health State     | % of Health (rounded up) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Healthy          | 100%                     |
| Wounded          | 50%                      |
| Severely Wounded | 25%                      |
| Incapacitated    | 0%                       |
| Dead             | Special                  |

### Health States

#### **Stunned**
- **Description:** You are unconscious but not incapacitated, usually from a taser or similar effect.
- **Effect:** Unable to take actions or reactions.

#### **Wounded**
- **Description:** You have taken significant damage and are impaired.
- **Effect:** All tests are at -3.

#### **Severely Wounded**
- **Description:** You are gravely injured and barely able to function.
- **Effect:** All tests are at -5.

#### **Incapacitated**
- **Description:** You are critically injured and unable to act.
- **Effect:** Fail all tests except for healing. You are unconscious.

### Dying

When you drop to zero hit points:
1. You fall unconscious if you were still conscious.
2. Any ongoing effects you were maintaining end.
3. You begin to bleed out.

Each round after hitting zero, you lose 1 hit point into the negatives. You can go into the negatives up to your Vitality value. Once you reach this limit, you are dead. While death is often permanent, the world of Gen6 is filled with possibilities that might offer a second chance.

### Sizes

| Size       | Description                |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Tiny       | Smaller than a human child |
| Small      | Human child size           |
| Medium     | Human size                 |
| Large      | Larger than a human        |
| Huge       | Much larger than a human   |
| Gargantuan | Enormous creatures         |
| Colossal   | Massive, towering beings   |

## Special Rolls

### Rolling 18
If you roll a 6 on all three dice (3d6 = 18), this is a **Critical Success**. In combat, it means you deal maximum damage without rolling. For skill checks, you succeed impressively, or at least fail gracefully if success was not possible.

### Rolling 3
If you roll a 1 on all three dice (3d6 = 3), this is a **Fumble**. It always results in a failure. This could mean a weapon jams, you run out of ammo, or you get tongue-tied during a negotiation. In high-risk situations, the GM may decide the failure is dramatically catastrophic.

## Courage

**Courage Points** allow characters to perform heroic feats. Spending a courage point grants a +3 bonus to a roll. The starting maximum is 3 points, which can be increased through advancement. Courage points recharge at the beginning of each session. To spend a courage point, you must invoke one of your character's values.

### Example:
- **Value:** "Justice must be served."
- **Situation:** Facing a notorious criminal in combat.
- **Action:** Spend a courage point to add +3 to your attack roll, ensuring you strike with greater accuracy.

### Summary

Combat in Gen6 is designed to be thrilling and dangerous, with an emphasis on strategy and quick thinking. By understanding the rules for actions, damage, and special conditions, players can navigate combat scenarios effectively, making the most of their characters' abilities and courage.
