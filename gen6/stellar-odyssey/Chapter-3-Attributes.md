### Chapter 3: Attributes

Attributes are the core characteristics that define your character's abilities in Gen6. They influence everything from how well you can perform physical feats to your ability to think logically or interact with others. Rolling and assigning your attributes is the first step in creating a character.

#### Rolling for Attributes

To determine your character's attributes, roll 3D six times. Record each result and assign these scores to the six primary attributes as you see fit. This allows you to tailor your character to your desired concept.

### Gen6 Primary Attributes Descriptions
- Strength is sheer muscle power and the ability to apply it, from lifting heavy things to athletic feats.
- Dexterity covers deftness, eye-hand coordination, agility, and reaction time, from doing delicate work to dodging attacks.
- Constitution is your character’s overall health, fortitude, and resistance to harm, illness, and fatigue.
- Intelligence measures a character’s reasoning, memory, problem-solving, overall knowledge, and education.
- Perception is the ability to detect things using any of the character’s senses.
- Social covers social skills, personal interaction, and the overall art of friendship and social influence.

### Attribute Table

The table below helps you understand the value ranges for each attribute, along with their corresponding modifiers. Modifiers apply to skill checks and other attribute-related rolls.

| Value | Modifier | Example   |
| ----- | -------- | --------- |
| 0-2   | -3       |           |
| 3     | -2       |           |
| 4-5   | -1       |           |
| 6-8   | 0        |           |
| 9-11  | +1       |           |
| 12-14 | +2       |           |
| 15-17 | +3       |           |
| 18    | +4       | Max Human |
| 19-20 | +4       |           |
| 21-23 | +5       |           |
| 24-26 | +6       |           |
| 27-30 | +7       | Just run  |

### Assigning Attribute Scores

After rolling 3D six times, you will have six numbers that represent your attribute scores. Assign these scores to the attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Perception, and Social) based on your character concept. Higher scores indicate areas where your character excels, while lower scores highlight areas where they may struggle.

Altrnatively you can take an array [5, 8, 8, 12, 12, 15]

### Example Attribute Assignment

Let's walk through an example of assigning attribute scores for a character named Alex, a former soldier turned investigator.

1. **Rolls:** 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12
2. **Attribute Assignment:**
   - Physical: 10 (+1)
   - Dexterity: 9 (+1)
   - Constitution: 12 (+2)
   - Intelligence: 7 (0)
   - Perception: 11 (+1)
   - Social: 5 (-1)

With these assignments, Alex is physically strong, agile, and perceptive, reflecting their background as a soldier. They are also resilient with high Vitality, making them tough in combat and able to recover quickly from injuries.

### Summary

Attributes are the foundation of your character in Gen6. By rolling and assigning these scores, you shape your character's strengths and weaknesses, setting the stage for their actions and interactions in the game.
