Chapter 10: Starships

### **Chapter 10: Starships**

In **Stellar Odyssey: Humanity's Journey**, starships are central to the game's narrative, facilitating travel, exploration, and combat in the vastness of space. This chapter provides comprehensive rules for building, piloting, and engaging in combat with starships. It covers skill use, combat mechanics, travel, and offers sample starships for immediate use.

---

### **Skills Used for Starships**

While several skills in the Gen6 system are useful, the following skills are crucial for the upkeep and operation of starships within Stellar Odyssey:

- **Computers:** Used for maintaining, repairing, and performing specific tasks with a ship’s automated systems.
- **Mechanics:** Essential for repairing and maintaining the physical components of a ship.
- **Astrogation:** Used for charting courses and plotting flight paths.
- **Piloting:** Required to drive or fly any starship in the game.

---

### **Spaceship Movement**

Starships in this chapter have three distinct speeds:

1. **Booster Speed:** Used for space combat, maneuvering in orbit, or flying planetside (ships move at half speed in an atmosphere).
2. **Cruising Speed:** Used for travel within a solar system.
3. **FTL Speed:** Utilizes the FTL Drive for interstellar travel.

For detailed information about long-distance travel, refer to the “Traveling in Spaceships” section of Chapter Eleven.

### **Ship-to-Ship Combat**

Combat between starships is essential for a galaxy-spanning adventure. This section clarifies the mechanics of space combat, ensuring straightforward and engaging encounters.

#### **Single-Pilot vs. Multi-Crew Ships**

- **Single-Pilot Ships:** Operate like a single player in combat. These include ships with a fighter chassis. The pilot moves the ship and uses spaceship actions, but can only fire one weapon per attack action.
- **Multi-Crew Ships:** Require coordination among the crew. It’s crucial to assign roles and know each character's location. The pilot cannot perform actions other than those using the Piloting skill unless they forgo a turn to disengage.

---

### **Initiative**

At the start of space combat, each player rolls initiative for their character. Group ships by size and allegiance for smoother combat flow. Determine if players are in single-pilot vessels or multi-crew ships.

---

### **Your Turn**

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. If piloting, move the ship up to its speed. You can take a bonus action but do not get a reaction unless you take the readied action.

At the end of the pilot's turn, they make a Piloting check modified by the ship’s handling modifier. The TN for this check is 10. For every 5 points above the TN, the ship gains a +1 DEF bonus until the pilot’s next turn.

---

### **Movement, Position, and Turning**

On the pilot’s turn, the ship moves forward by its arc value (100 feet). To make a 90-degree turn, the ship must move forward a distance equal to its turning value. Facing affects only movement, not aiming.

---

### **Collisions**

When ships collide, each takes 2d10 damage per point of body the other ship has. This damage is dealt directly to the hull. If a ship intentionally collides, the pilot must make a contested Piloting check. Failure gives the defender advantage on attack rolls against the aggressor.

---

### **Actions in Space**

| Action          | Combat Check Required |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Attack          | Varies                |
| Countermeasures | Computers/Mechanics   |
| Dash            | Piloting              |
| Divert Power    | Mechanics             |
| Hack            | Computers             |
| Help            | N/A                   |
| Open a Line     | N/A                   |
| Patch           | Mechanics             |
| Ready an Attack | N/A                   |
| Scan            | Computers             |
| Take Off/Land   | Piloting              |
| Trick Maneuver  | Piloting              |

---

### **Detailed Actions**

#### **Attack**

- **Gunnery Skill:** Required to fire ship weapons.
- **Single-Pilot Ships:** Can only fire one weapon per attack action.
- **Multi-Crew Ships:** Each weapon can be fired by a different crew member. Multiple attacks are possible if the ship has multiple weapons.

---

#### **Countermeasures**

- **Physical Attack:** Mechanics check opposed to the attack roll. Success halves the damage.
- **Hacking Attack:** Computers check with +2 bonus against the hack attempt. Failure boots the hacker from the network.

---

#### **Dash**

Piloting check (TN 15) allows the ship to move again at half speed. Exceeding the check by 10 or more allows full speed movement.

---

#### **Hack**

- **Primary Terminal:** Allows hacking within 7 arc. Requires bypassing the target’s AI core or active terminal operator.
- **Computers Check:** Opposed by the target’s defenses.

---

#### **Help**

Provides a +2 bonus to another’s roll if within 5 feet or 5 arc.

---

#### **Open a Line**

Establish communication with another ship within 30 arc. Either ship can close the line as a bonus action.

---

#### **Patch**

- **Mechanics Check (TN 15):** Restores 1d10 + Mechanics rank barrier points. Failed attempts lower the TN by 5 (minimum TN 5) until successful.

---

#### **Ready an Attack**

Choose a weapon and condition for firing. Gain a special reaction to make the attack if the condition is met before the next turn.

---

#### **Scan**

- **Computers Check (TN 15):** Provides information about another ship within 50 arc. Each 5 points above the TN reveals additional information.

---

#### **Take Off/Land**

- **Piloting Check (TN 10):** Used for taking off, landing, docking, or detaching. The handling modifier applies.

---

### **Spaceship Chases**

Spaceship chases function similarly to vehicle chases but in the vastness of space.

#### **Initiating a Chase**

- **Roll Initiative:** Each character rolls, with the pilot's turn determining ship movement.
- **Opposed Piloting Check:** Determines the distance between ships.

#### **Stages of Distance**

- **Stage 0:** Less than 1 arc. Ships can ram, board, and fire weapons.
- **Stage 1:** 15 arc from the lead ship.
- **Stage 2:** 30 arc from the lead ship.
- **Stage 3:** 45 arc from the lead ship. Beyond this, the pursuer falls out of the chase.

---


#### **The Base Ship**

The base ship includes the ship's essential facets, described in detail below:

- **Size:** Ships come in 7 sizes: Tiny (20-40 feet), Small (40-100 feet), Medium (100-400 feet), Large (400-1,000 feet), Huge (1,000-5,000 feet), and Gargantuan (5,000+ feet).
- **Base HP:** Hit points of the ship. A ship becomes inoperable at 0 HP and is wrecked, not destroyed, until it takes additional damage equal to half its total HP.
- **Armor:** Represents the ship's hardiness. Damage less than this value is reduced to 0.
- **Speed/Handling:** Speed in arc units (1 arc = 100 feet). Handling is a bonus or penalty to piloting skill checks or defense checks.
- **Turn:** The number of arcs a ship must move forward before making a 90-degree turn.
- **Charge:** Time in rounds required for the engines to start from cold rest.
- **Weapon Slots (WS):** Number of slots available for weapons.
- **Development Slots (DS):** Number of slots available for ship developments.
- **Crew:** Minimum and maximum crew required to operate the ship. Most medium or larger ships can carry four times their crew in passengers.

### **Battle Weapons Systems**

The following features apply to the types of weapons that can be acquired for a ship.

#### **Size**
Each weapon is restricted to certain sizes of ships. This column describes which sizes a given system will work for: T stands for tiny, S for small, M for medium, L for large, H for huge, and G for gargantuan.

#### **Range**
This column dictates the range at which the weapon works using the terms contact (0 arc units), close (0-7 arc units), mid (0-15 arc units), or long (0-30 arc units). Weapons with long range impose disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets within 7 arcs.

#### **Recharge**
This value shows the number of rounds a weapon requires to recharge before it can be used again.

#### **Slots**
This value dictates the number of weapon slots (WS) the weapon uses in a ship.

#### **Damage**
This describes the damage of the weapon and details whether it requires an Attack roll or a Save. Attack requires an attack roll against the target’s DEF, while Save requires a Quickness check by the pilot of the target ship against a TN equal to 10 + your Agility or Logic modifier (whichever is better). Weapons marked SP have special entries below. Ship weapons deal additional damage to creatures. See “Spaceship vs. Person” for more information.

#### **Tractor Beam**
This weapon emits a small 2-arc cone. Any object caught in the cone is immediately halted. The user can then draw objects toward their ship at a rate of 1 arc per round. This weapon has no effect on ships but can be used on large and smaller creatures.

#### **Centurion Missile**
The initial purchase includes a single missile; individual missiles cost 2,500 UC each thereafter. Centurion missiles deal massive damage but do not affect barriers, only ships and objects. If a ship has an active barrier, the missile may hit but deals no damage.

---

### **Ship Developments**

These additional systems and structures use the DS (development slot) column of the chart in this chapter. Each development occupies a number of development slots on a ship and provides modifications for various uses. Most developments can be purchased multiple times, but some are restricted to one per ship.

---
