Refueling a starship at a Starbase or a Spaceport should take into account various factors such as the size of the starship, the type of fuel used, and the economic context within the setting of **Stellar Odyssey: Humanity's Journey**. Here is a structured approach to determine the refueling cost:

### Refueling Costs

#### Cost Calculation Formula
The refueling cost can be calculated using the following formula:
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Base Cost per Unit} \times \text{Fuel Units Needed} \times \text{Size Multiplier} \]

1. **Base Cost per Unit**: The standard cost for a single unit of ZPE fuel. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume 1 unit of ZPE fuel costs **50 UC**.
2. **Fuel Units Needed**: This depends on the type and size of the starship. Each type of ship will have a predefined amount of fuel units it needs for a full refuel.
3. **Size Multiplier**: A modifier based on the size of the ship to account for larger ships requiring more resources and time to refuel.

### Size Categories and Multipliers
| Ship Size  | Example Ships                  | Size Multiplier |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Tiny       | Fighter, Shuttle               | 1x              |
| Small      | Light Freighter                | 2x              |
| Medium     | Pioneer, Light Transporter     | 3x              |
| Large      | Battleship, Heavy Freighter    | 4x              |
| Huge       | Cruiser, Heavy Transporter     | 5x              |
