## Flaws

### All Thumbs (Severity 1)
Due to upbringing, lack of exposure, or
pure bad luck, some individuals are “all
thumbs” when it comes to mechanical or
technological devices.
All Thumbs inflicts a −2 penalty when using
mechanical or electrical devices. If he rolls a
Critical Failure while using such a device
(and it doesn’t already have a built-in effect),
it’s broken. If the GM feels it’s appropriate, it
can be fixed with a Repair roll and 1d6 hours.

### Anemic (Severity 1)
Anemic characters are particularly susceptible
to sickness, disease, environmental effects,
and fatigue. They subtract 2 from Stamina rolls
made to resist Fatigue 

### Arrogant (Severity 2)
Your hero doesn’t think he’s the best—he
knows he is. Whether it’s swordsmanship,
kung fu, or painting, few compare to his skills
and he flaunts it every chance he gets.
Winning isn’t enough for this champion.
He wants to dominate his opponent and
prove there’s no one better. He’s the kind of
fighter who disarms an opponent in a duel
just to pick the sword up and hand it back
with a smirk. Arrogant individuals look for
the greatest threat in battle, hacking their way
through lesser minions only because they’re
in the way.

### Bad Eyes (Severity 1 or Severity 2)
Your hero’s eyes aren’t what they used to
be. He suffers a −1 penalty to any roll
dependent on vision (such as ranged attacks

In settings where glasses are available,
they negate the penalty when worn. If lost
or broken during a combat (generally a
