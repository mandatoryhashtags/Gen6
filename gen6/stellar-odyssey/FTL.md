### **Development and Theoretical Foundation**

#### **Early Theories**

The concept of FTL travel began with early 21st-century advancements in theoretical physics. Inspired by general relativity and quantum mechanics, scientists proposed various methods for achieving faster-than-light travel, including wormholes, Alcubierre drives, and quantum tunneling.

#### **Breakthrough Discovery**

In 2015, a breakthrough occurred when researchers at the CERN particle accelerator detected anomalies in space-time that hinted at the possibility of creating a controlled warp bubble. This discovery set the stage for the development of the first practical FTL engine, known as the Alcubierre Drive, named after the theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre.

### **The Alcubierre Drive**

#### **Principle of Operation**

The Alcubierre Drive operates on the principle of creating a warp bubble around a spacecraft. This bubble contracts space in front of the ship and expands it behind, allowing the vessel to move faster than light without violating the laws of physics within the bubble. The ship itself remains stationary within the bubble, avoiding relativistic effects.

#### **Energy Requirements**

Initially, the energy requirements for generating a stable warp bubble were astronomical, far beyond the capabilities of early 21st-century technology. However, the discovery of zero-point energy and the development of advanced fusion reactors provided the necessary power to sustain FTL travel.
