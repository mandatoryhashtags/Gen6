### **2. Vehicle Statistics**

#### **Speed**

- **Top Speed:** The maximum speed the vehicle can reach.
- **Cruising Speed:** The comfortable speed for long-distance travel without straining the vehicle.

#### **HP (Hit Points)**

- **HP:** The durability and hit points of the vehicle. Damage reduces the body points, and once they reach zero, the vehicle is incapacitated.

#### **Maneuverability**

- **Maneuverability:** A modifier to rolls for performing complex maneuvers. Positive modifiers indicate better handling, while negative modifiers indicate more difficulty.

#### **Weapons**

- **Weapons:** Some vehicles come equipped with weapons. Each weapon has a specified damage value (e.g., 3D) and is designed for different combat scenarios.

### **3. Chase and Pursuit Rules**

Chases and pursuits are common in **Stellar Odyssey**, whether escaping from enemies or chasing down targets. The following rules provide a framework for handling these high-speed situations.

#### **Initiating a Chase**

1. **Determine Pursuer and Quarry:** Identify who is pursuing and who is being pursued.
2. **Establish Starting Positions:** Determine the initial distance between the pursuer and the quarry, usually measured in range increments (e.g., Close, Medium, Long).

#### **Chase Sequence**

1. **Initiative Roll:** Each participant rolls for initiative to determine the order of actions.
2. **Maneuvering Checks:** Each participant makes a maneuvering check using their vehicle's maneuverability modifier. The result determines if they gain, lose, or maintain distance.
   - **Success:** The participant gains or maintains distance.
   - **Failure:** The participant loses distance.

#### **Distance Changes**

- **Gaining Distance:** If the quarry succeeds and the pursuer fails, the distance increases.
- **Losing Distance:** If the pursuer succeeds and the quarry fails, the distance decreases.
- **Maintaining Distance:** If both succeed or both fail, the distance remains the same.

#### **Obstacles**

- **Encountering Obstacles:** During a chase, obstacles may appear. Each participant must make a maneuvering check to avoid or navigate the obstacle.
  - **Success:** The participant avoids the obstacle.
  - **Failure:** The participant hits the obstacle and takes damage (determined by the GM).

#### **Ending the Chase**

- **Catching the Quarry:** If the pursuer reduces the distance to zero, they catch the quarry.
- **Escape:** If the quarry increases the distance to a predetermined maximum (e.g., Long range +3 increments), they escape.

#### **Example Chase**

- **Initiate:** A patrol airship (pursuer) is chasing a cargo hovercraft (quarry) in a dense cityscape.
- **Starting Position:** Medium range.
- **First Round:**
  - **Initiative:** Both roll initiative. Patrol airship goes first.
  - **Maneuvering Check:** Patrol airship rolls 3D + Maneuverability (0). Cargo hovercraft rolls 3D + Maneuverability (+2).
  - **Results:** Patrol airship fails, cargo hovercraft succeeds. Distance increases to Long range.
- **Second Round:**
  - **Initiative:** Both roll again. Cargo hovercraft goes first.
  - **Maneuvering Check:** Cargo hovercraft rolls 3D + Maneuverability (+2). Patrol airship rolls 3D + Maneuverability (0).
  - **Results:** Cargo hovercraft fails, patrol airship succeeds. Distance returns to Medium range.
- **Obstacle:** GM introduces a building as an obstacle.
  - **Avoiding Obstacle:** Both make maneuvering checks.
  - **Results:** Patrol airship fails, takes 10 damage. Cargo hovercraft succeeds and continues.
