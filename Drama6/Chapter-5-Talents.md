# Talents
Your character has areas of natural aptitude and special training
called talents. These provide a way to customize your character
that goes beyond their background, making choosing talents
an important part of developing your character.

Each talent is divided into three degrees: Novice, Expert,
and Master. (Note that “Expert” replaces the “Journeyman”
degree in other Adventure Game Engine games, and they
should be considered equivalent.) Each of these provides
a game system benefit. You have to be a Novice in a talent
before you can become an Expert, and an Expert before you
can become a Master.

You acquire your initial talents at character creation, from
your background, profession, and drive. You gain new talents
and new degrees by gaining levels. Most talents also have
requirements, like specific focuses or weapon groups. Unless
you acquired the talent at character creation, you cannot take
the talent unless you meet these requirements.

When talents are listed for a character, the standard format is
talent first, followed by the degree achieved in parentheses.
Command (Expert), for example, or Speed Demon (Novice).
A catalog of available talents follows, using this format:

### TALENT NAME
- Requirement:
- Description: Brief description of the talent

## Talent Descriptions

### Animal Training
- Requirement: None
- You know how to train animals.
- Novice: You know the basics of dealing with animals. With a
week of training, you can teach an animal to follow a simple
one-word command like “heel,” “follow,” or “attack.” You
can teach a single animal a number of commands equal to
your Charm.
- Expert: You can train animals to follow more complex
commands, like “guard this place” or “return to me when
strangers approach.” Teaching a complex command takes 2
weeks of training and the total number of commands a single
animal can learn is equal to your Charm + 2.
- Master: Your training can turn animals into prime examples
of their kind. With a month of training, you can increase an
animal’s Dexterity or Strength by 1. It also gains Willpower +2 An animal can receive such training only once.

### Archery Style
- Requirement: Firearms (Archert) focus
- You are experienced with bows and crossbows.
- Novice: When you take the Aim action, your next attack
with a bow or crossbow inflicts +1 damage in addition to the
normal benefits of aiming.
- Expert: When you attack from hiding with a bow or crossbow
and fail, you remain hidden. If the attack is successful, you
can immediately make a new Stealth test if there
is cover within 4 yards and you have not moved yet in your
turn. You can enjoy each benefit only once in the same combat.
- Master: When shooting a bow or crossbow, you can ignore 25% cover

### Advanced Medicine
- Requirement: Any Medicine focus
- You can repair broken bodies and treat the roots of a disease.
- Novice: You react to unexpected complications when treating a patient. You can re-roll any dice with a result of 1 or 2 when making an Medicine test, but you must keep the result of the second roll.
- Expert: Your skill in surgery can save lives from the brink of death. You can operate on another character with the proper tools and/or location for 1 hour. After the operation, the treated character recovers an amount of Health equal to 10 + your total Medicine bonus. 
- Master: You can remedy the crippling effects of most injuries. When you use the First Aid action you can heal 10 + your total Medicine Bonus

### Burglary
- Requirement: Dexterity +2 or higher
- Private property is a foreign concept. You know how to bypass security to enter a place and take anything that strikes your fancy.
- Novice: You know your way around security systems. When you succeed at an Security test to study a lock, alarm, guards, or any part of a security system or protocol, the  GM provides you with one more piece of information.
- Expert: Security measures cannot stop you. If you fail a Security test, you can re-roll it, but you must keep the results of the second roll.
- Master: No valuable can escape your notice. If you fail a Notice test for searching, you can re-roll it, but you must keep the results of the second roll.

### Contacts
- Requirement: Social +1 or higher
- You know people, sometimes in the unlikeliest places.
- Novice: You can attempt to make a contact out of an NPC with a Neutral or better attitude toward you with a successful
Charm test. The GM will set the target number based on the likelihood of you knowing the NPC or having mutual friends. The more distant the NPC’s origin or social class from yours, the more difficult the test will be. A contact’s attitude shifts one step in your favor, and they will readily provide information without a test, as long as it wouldn’t harm them. They will usually not perform other favors without further persuasion.
- Expert: Once you’ve established a contact, you can try to get
a favor with a single successful Charm test, regardless of their attitude toward you and without engaging in a complex social interaction. The target number is based on the nature of the favor and whether it puts the contact in any danger.
- Master: You can turn an acquaintance into an ally with a show of loyalty. If you do a significant favor for an established contact, they will automatically become Very Friendly, and any potential risk in the favors you ask of them will not affect the target number of the Charm test from the Expert degree. If they’re already Very Friendly, they become zealously loyal; you do not need to make an ability test to ask favors of them, regardless of any danger involved, and the GM can use your ally to provide prompts if you become stuck in the course of a story, in the form of unsolicited advice or favors. These allies’ attitudes can drop if they’re not treated well, but never fade with the passage of time. You can drift apart for a decade and they’ll be as loyal as when you last met.

### Dual Weapon Style
- Requirement: Dexterity +2 or higher
- You can fight in hand-to-hand combat with a weapon in your main hand (your primary weapon) and another in your off hand (your secondary weapon). Neither can be a two-handed weapon, and the secondary weapon is considered to have a Minimum Strength +2 higher than normal (you’d need Strength +1 to use a short sword as a secondary weapon, for example). Unless otherwise stated, your attacks come from the primary weapon.
- Novice: Wielding two weapons can aid you in attack or defense. If you take the Activate action, you can gain either a +1 bonus on your melee attack rolls or a +1 Defense bonus vs. melee attacks until the end of the encounter. You can switch the bonus you are taking with another Activate action. 
- Expert: If you make a attack with your primary weapon and you are not charging, you can make another
attack with your secondary weapon as a minor action. You do not gain your Attributes bonus to hit or any to damage
- Master: You can overwhelm opponents with blows from both weapons. If you make a attack with your primary
weapon and you are not charging, you can make another
attack with your secondary weapon as a minor action. You now gain your attribute bonus to attack and half Strength modifier to damage for Melee attacks with the secondary weapon

### Emergency Care 
- Requirement: Intelligence 1 or higher
- You can treat wounds and illnesses in the field. 
- Novice: You have trained as an emergency medical technician, and your aid is swift and sure. First Aid is a minor actionfor you. 
- Expert: If you’re not a certified paramedic, you should be. When you use the First Aid action, your ally gets back an amount of Health equal to (Max Die × 2) + Intelligence Modifier. 
- Master: You can patch up the most grievous wounds. When you use the First Aid action, your ally gets back an amount of Health equal to (Max Die × 3) + Intelligence Mod.
