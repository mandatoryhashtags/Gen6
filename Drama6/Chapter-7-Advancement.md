### Chapter 7: Advancement Between Sessions

Advancement in Gen6 allows characters to grow and evolve as they gain experience. This system rewards players with points they can use to improve their skills, attributes, and abilities.

## Advancement Points

Advancements are typically awarded at the end of an adventure, with each advancement providing 5 points. NPCs tend to gain an advancement for every twelve months of service. These points can be spent to enhance various aspects of your character.

- **Subsequent Ranks:** Current rank per point

#### Example
- **Firearms 3 to 4:** 3 points

You can only raise a skill by 1 point per advancement period.

### Focuses

#### Cost
- **Focus Cost:** 1 point per focus

You can take multiple focuses per advancement, but not for the same skill.

### Attributes

Attributes are crucial for your character’s performance and can be increased up to the racial maximum (12 for Humans).

#### Cost
- **Attribute Cost:** Desired rank * 10 points

### Courage

Courage points are vital for performing heroic feats and can be increased to enhance your character’s bravery.

#### Cost
- **Courage Cost:** 3 points per courage point

### Edges

Edges provide unique advantages or abilities to your character. The cost of edges varies and is listed individually.

## Example Advancement Costs

### Skill Rank Advancement

| Skill Rank | Cost to Move Up 1 | Total Cost |

| 1          | 1                 | 1          |
| 2          | 2                 | 3          |
| 3          | 3                 | 6          |
| 4          | 4                 | 10         |
| 5          | 5                 | 15         |
| 6          | 6                 | 21         |
| 7          | 7                 | 28         |
| 8          | 8                 | 36         |
| 9          | 9                 | 45         |
| 10         | -                 | 55         |

### Attributes

Attributes are straightforward to upgrade. The cost to increase an attribute is calculated by multiplying the desired rank by 10.

#### Example
- **Increasing Agility from 7 to 8:** 8 * 10 = 80 points

### Building a Character Entirely by Points

It is possible to build a character entirely by spending points. This approach allows for a highly customizable and balanced character creation process.

## Summary

Advancement in Gen6 is a flexible system that rewards character growth and specialization. By understanding the costs associated with skills, focuses, attributes, courage, and edges, players can make informed decisions about how to evolve their characters. This system encourages continuous development and adaptation, making each adventure a step towards greater prowess and capability.
