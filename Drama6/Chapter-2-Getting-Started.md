- Character sheets (available for download or provided by your Game Master)
- Pencils or pens for taking notes

### Step-by-Step Character Creation

Creating your character in Stellar Odyssey is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to bring your character to life:

#### **Step 1: Decide Who Your Character Is**
Start by defining your character's core identity. Consider their values, beliefs, and background. Write down three facts about your character. These can be a sentence or a few words that capture their essence.
- **Example:**
  - Believes in justice and fairness
  - A former soldier with a mysterious past
  - Has a fear of heights

#### **Step 2: Assign Attributes**
Roll 3D six times and assign the results to your character's six primary attributes as desired. The primary attributes are:
- Strength is sheer muscle power and the ability to apply it, from lifting heavy things to athletic feats.
- Dexterity covers deftness, eye-hand coordination, agility, and reaction time, from doing delicate work to dodging attacks.
- Constitution is your character’s overall health, fortitude, and resistance to harm, illness, and fatigue.
- Intelligence measures a character’s reasoning, memory, problem-solving, overall knowledge, and education.
- Perception is the ability to detect things using any of the character’s senses.
- Social covers social skills, personal interaction, and the overall art of friendship and social influence.

#### **Step 3: Spend Skill Points**
You have 20 skill points to distribute among your skills. No skill may be higher than +5 at character creation. Skills cost 1 per during character creation but cost more afterward. You also gain 1 Talent.

#### **Step 4: Calculate Derived Numbers**
Calculate your character's derived attributes based on the following formulas:
- **Quickness:** Your highest modifier from either Intelligence or Dexterity. This is added to rolls to dodge out of the way of attacks, area of effects like grenades, and perform fast actions like catch a falling object
- **Stamina:** Your highest modifier from either Strength or Constitution. This is added to rolls to resist effects like poison, radiation, exhaustion.
- **Willpower:** Your highest modifier from either Social or Perception. This is added to rolls to resist the affects of Mind Control, Maintain composure, etc.
- **Defense:** 10 + Your Dexterity Modifier - This is the TN enemies need to hit you
- **Health Points (HP):** Your Constitution value + your Physical modifier + 20.
- **Toughness:** Your Constitution Modifier - This is reduced from damage unless are are wearing armor you use the armor resistance value instead
- **Courage:** All characters start with a Courage score of 3.
- **Speed:** Humans speed is 10 yards

> If the GM wants a more dangerous game half the HP bonus, if they want a deadly game remove HP and have the characters take damage to their Constitution to 0 and then either their Dexterity or Strength. When the second one reaches 0, they are unconcious, if the third drops to 0 they are dead. This is deadlier because they start taking negatives on rolls really fast.
