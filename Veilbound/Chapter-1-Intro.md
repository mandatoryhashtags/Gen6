### Setting for Veilbound: Modern Horror in the Early 90s

Welcome to the world of **Veilbound**, where the mundane and the mystical coexist, separated by a fragile veil of secrecy. Set in the early 1990s, this modern horror setting blends elements from *Supernatural*, *Dresden Files*, *Grimm*, *True Blood*, *Torchwood*, and *Call of Cthulhu*. In this world, the mundane citizens ("Mundus") live their lives unaware of the hidden realities that the awakened beings ("Awakened") navigate daily.

## The Awakened World

### The Veil

The Veil is the invisible barrier that separates the Mundus from the Awakened. It’s maintained by a delicate balance of secrecy and magic, ensuring that the mundane world remains blissfully ignorant of the supernatural forces around them.

### The Enforcers

**The Enforcers** are a secretive organization dedicated to maintaining the Veil. They ensure that the mundane world remains unaware of the Awakened, and they deal with any threats that risk exposing this hidden world. Enforcers are a blend of skilled operatives, mages, and supernatural beings who are committed to their cause. They operate under a strict code of conduct, ensuring that the Veil is preserved at all costs.

### The Hunters

**Hunters** are individuals or groups who track and eliminate supernatural threats that do not abide by the rules set forth by the Enforcers. They are often independent operators but sometimes work with the Enforcers to deal with particularly dangerous entities. Hunters possess specialized knowledge and tools to combat a wide range of supernatural creatures.

### Factions at Play

#### The Council of Shadows
A governing body of powerful Awakened individuals who oversee the enforcement of the Veil. They dictate the rules and ensure compliance among the Awakened. The Council is composed of representatives from various supernatural races and magical disciplines.

#### The Order of the Silver Dawn
A secret society of mages and scholars dedicated to understanding and cataloging the supernatural. They provide support to the Enforcers and Hunters, offering knowledge, resources, and magical artifacts.

#### The Blood Pact
A faction of vampires who have formed an uneasy alliance with the Enforcers. They police their kind to ensure that rogue vampires do not endanger the Veil. The Blood Pact is led by ancient and powerful vampires who value the secrecy and stability provided by the Veil.

#### The Wild Hunt
A loose coalition of werewolves and other shapeshifters who hunt supernatural threats. They are fiercely territorial and often come into conflict with other factions. The Wild Hunt values strength, honor, and the primal bonds of their kind.

#### The Cult of Nyx
A dangerous and secretive cult dedicated to summoning eldritch horrors from beyond the Veil. They seek to disrupt the balance and bring about a new world order. The Cult of Nyx is often at odds with all other factions due to their destructive goals.

### Rules and Regulations

The Veil is protected by a set of ancient rules that all Awakened must follow:
1. **Secrecy:** The existence of the Awakened must be kept secret from the Mundus.
2. **Non-Interference:** Awakened beings must not interfere with the lives of the Mundus in ways that could reveal their existence.
3. **Justice:** Any Awakened who endangers the Veil must be brought to justice, whether through trial or hunting.
4. **Balance:** The natural balance between the Mundus and the Awakened must be maintained, avoiding large-scale disruptions.

### Notable Locations

#### The Nexus
A hidden city beneath the streets of a St Louis under the arch, the Nexus serves as a safe haven for the Awakened. It is a bustling hub where supernatural beings can interact freely, away from the prying eyes of the Mundus.

#### The Library of Shadows
A vast, secretive library maintained by the Order of the Silver Dawn. It contains tomes and artifacts of immense power and knowledge, available only to those with the proper clearance.

#### The Blood Sanctuary
A fortified mansion serving as the headquarters for the Blood Pact. It is a place of power and refuge for vampires, guarded by ancient magics and loyal thralls.

#### The Huntsman’s Lodge
A remote, heavily fortified compound used by the Wild Hunt as a base of operations. It is filled with weapons, training areas, and trophies from past hunts.

#### The Void Temple
An eerie, abandoned cathedral that serves as the meeting place for the Cult of Nyx. Dark rituals and summoning ceremonies are conducted here, far from the eyes of the Enforcers.

### Conclusion

In the world of Veilbound, the balance between the mundane and the mystical is a constant struggle. With a rich tapestry of factions, rules, and hidden locations, the setting offers endless possibilities for thrilling adventures. Whether you are enforcing the Veil, hunting rogue creatures, or uncovering ancient secrets, the world of Veilbound promises excitement and danger at every turn.
