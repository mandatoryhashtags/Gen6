## Flaws

### All Thumbs (Severity 1)
Due to upbringing, lack of exposure, or
pure bad luck, some individuals are “all
thumbs” when it comes to mechanical or
technological devices.
All Thumbs inflicts a −2 penalty when using
mechanical or electrical devices. If he rolls a
Critical Failure while using such a device
(and it doesn’t already have a built-in effect),
it’s broken. If the GM feels it’s appropriate, it
can be fixed with a Repair roll and 1d6 hours.

### Anemic (Severity 1)
Anemic characters are particularly susceptible
to sickness, disease, environmental effects,
and fatigue. They subtract 2 from Stamina rolls
made to resist Fatigue 

### Arrogant (Severity 2)
Your hero doesn’t think he’s the best—he
knows he is. Whether it’s swordsmanship,
kung fu, or painting, few compare to his skills
and he flaunts it every chance he gets.
Winning isn’t enough for this champion.
He wants to dominate his opponent and
prove there’s no one better. He’s the kind of
fighter who disarms an opponent in a duel
just to pick the sword up and hand it back
with a smirk. Arrogant individuals look for
the greatest threat in battle, hacking their way
through lesser minions only because they’re
in the way.

### Bad Eyes (Severity 1 or Severity 2)
Your hero’s eyes aren’t what they used to
be. He suffers a −1 penalty to any roll
dependent on vision (such as ranged attacks
and Notice rolls) or −2 as a Severity 2 Flaw.
In settings where glasses are available,
they negate the penalty when worn. If lost
or broken during a combat (generally a
50% chance when he’s Wounded, falls, or
suffers some other trauma), the character
is Distracted (and Vulnerable if a Severity 2 Flaw) until the end of their next turn.

### Clumsy (Severity 1)

### Distrustful (Severity 1)
Your character has a hard time trusting others. They have a −2 penalty to Social rolls involving persuasion, negotiation, and cooperation with strangers or those they distrust.

### Frail (Severity 2)
Your character's physical condition is poor, making them more susceptible to injury and illness. They have a −2 penalty to rolls involving physical endurance and strength, and take an additional point of damage from all sources.

### Greedy (Severity 1)
Your character has a strong desire for wealth and material possessions. They have a −2 penalty to Social rolls when resisting bribes or offers of treasure, and may take unnecessary risks to acquire valuables.

### Impulsive (Severity 2)
Your character acts without thinking, often rushing into situations without considering the consequences. They have a −2 penalty to Logic rolls when making decisions under pressure and may be prone to rash actions.

### Loner (Severity 1)
Your character prefers to work alone and struggles in group settings. They have a −2 penalty to Social rolls when cooperating with a team or following group plans.

### Overconfident (Severity 1)
Your character has an inflated sense of their own abilities, leading them to take on challenges beyond their capabilities. They have a −2 penalty to Perception rolls when assessing threats or evaluating their own skills realistically.

### Phobia (Severity 2)

### Weak-Willed (Severity 1)
Your character is easily swayed by others and has difficulty standing up for themselves. They have a −2 penalty to Willpower rolls when resisting persuasion, intimidation, or mind control.

### Unlucky (Severity 2)
Your character seems to attract bad luck. Once per session, the GM may impose a −2 penalty on a roll of their choice for the character, representing an unfortunate turn of events.

### Vengeful (Severity 1)
Your character holds grudges and seeks revenge, often at their own detriment. They have a −2 penalty to Logic rolls when considering forgiving someone or letting go of a past wrong, and may pursue vengeance over practical solutions.

### Nightmares (Severity 1)
Your character is plagued by frequent nightmares, affecting their rest and mental state. They have a −2 penalty to Perception rolls due to fatigue and may struggle with concentration during the day.

Your character has a compassionate nature and struggles to inflict harm or witness suffering. They have a −2 penalty to Attack rolls and Intimidation rolls when the target is perceived as vulnerable or innocent.
