### Assigning Attribute Scores

After rolling 2d6 six times, you will have six numbers that represent your attribute scores. Assign these scores to the attributes (Physical, Agility, Vitality, Logic, Perception, and Social) based on your character concept. Higher scores indicate areas where your character excels, while lower scores highlight areas where they may struggle.

### Example Attribute Assignment

Let's walk through an example of assigning attribute scores for a character named Alex, a former soldier turned investigator.

1. **Rolls:** 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12
2. **Attribute Assignment:**
   - Physical: 10 (+2)
   - Agility: 9 (+1)
   - Vitality: 12 (+3)
   - Logic: 7 (0)
   - Perception: 11 (+2)
   - Social: 5 (0)

With these assignments, Alex is physically strong, agile, and perceptive, reflecting their background as a soldier. They are also resilient with high Vitality, making them tough in combat and able to recover quickly from injuries.
