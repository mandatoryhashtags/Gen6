### Step-by-Step Character Creation

Creating your character in Veilbound is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to bring your character to life:

#### **Step 1: Decide Who Your Character Is**
Start by defining your character's core identity. Consider their values, beliefs, and background. Write down three facts about your character. These can be a sentence or a few words that capture their essence.
- **Example:**
  - Believes in justice and fairness
  - A former soldier with a mysterious past
  - Has a fear of heights

#### **Step 2: Assign Attributes**
Roll 2d6 six times and assign the results to your character's six primary attributes as desired. The primary attributes are:
- **Physical:** Represents raw physical strength and endurance.
- **Agility:** Measures reflexes, coordination, and overall nimbleness.
- **Vitality:** Reflects overall health, resilience, and ability to recover from injuries.
- **Logic:** Represents intellectual abilities, including reasoning and problem-solving.
- **Perception:** Measures awareness of surroundings and ability to notice details.
- **Social:** Reflects ability to interact with others, including charm and persuasion.

#### **Step 3: Spend Skill Points**
You have 20 skill points to distribute among your skills. No skill may be higher than +5 at character creation. Also, gain one more Edge. Skills cost 1 per during character creation but cost more afterward

#### **Step 4: Calculate Derived Numbers**
Calculate your character's derived attributes based on the following formulas:
- **Quickness:** 10 + your highest modifier from either Logic or Agility. This is the target number (TN) for enemies to hit you with ranged or melee weapons.
- **Stamina:** 10 + your highest modifier from either Physical or Vitality. This is the TN for resisting poisons, radiation, exertion, and some other effects.
- **Willpower:** 10 + your highest modifier from either Logic or Perception. This is the TN for overcoming logic puzzles, resisting mind control, and certain other effects.
- **Health Points (HP):** Your Vitality value + your Physical modifier + 20.
- **Courage:** All characters start with a Courage score of 3.
