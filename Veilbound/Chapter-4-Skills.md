### Defaulting

Defaulting is when you use a skill without having any points in the skill, relying solely on your attribute and natural talent. Some skills cannot be defaulted and require special training and expertise to perform, but most skills can be defaulted. When you default to a skill, you use the relevant attribute modifier without any skill bonus. Defaulting has a penalty of -3. 

**Example:**
Alex has an Agility of 9 with a Dice Modifier of +1. Alex has a 0 or no skills in Driving. 

He rolls 3d6 + 1 - 3 (for defaulting). He rolls an 11, resulting in a final number of 9.

9 = 11 + 1 - 3

### Languages

Language is not treated as a skill in Gen6. Instead, individual languages are considered part of your character's background. Every character gets their native language at a proficiency of 5 for free. Additional languages can be added if relevant to your character's backstory or if learned during gameplay.

### Focuses

A focus is a niche area where your character is particularly skilled within a broader skill category. For example, if your character has Firearms 3 and frequently uses pistols, you can take a focus in pistols.

**Example:**
- **Firearms 3:** General proficiency with firearms.
- **Firearms (Pistols) 3:** Has a focus proficiency with pistols, gaining an additional +2 to rolls involving pistols.

You can only take a focus once, but you can take multiple focuses for the same base skill. There is no predefined list of focuses; you are encouraged to work with your Game Master to create appropriate focuses for your character.

**Note:** This is not the final list of skills. If you believe your character should know about a specific area, such as Law, you can create that skill and spend points in it, with approval from the Game Master. This flexibility allows for a wide range of knowledge-based skills that enhance role-playing without unbalancing the game.
