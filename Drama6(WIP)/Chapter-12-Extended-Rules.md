# Extended Rules

## Investigations

### Simple Investigations
Some investigation scenes are very simple. Succeed at an ability test against a TN set by the GM, and you win the information you need. You just need to be in the right place at the right time. In some cases, a roll won’t be required. The information is either obvious once you get there, or the GM assumes your character has the interest and ability to find it. The GM may also ask for a specific focus that represents the required knowledge or intuition to notice the information.

### Detailed Investigations
Some investigations must be carried out across multiple steps, forming an investigative trail. Each step on the trail is a lead, and discovering the significance of a lead unearths a clue and a new lead. Discovering all clues produces a reveal the ultimate truth the clues uncover.

A trail doesn’t need to be a linear path. It can have many branches, but in most cases following any branch to the end will produce the same reveal. The GM should avoid putting dead ends in an investigation, unless an enemy blocks the trail deliberately, or as a momentary setback that can be reversed by creative heroes.

The GM doesn’t need to pre-plan the trail; they can improvise depending on what the heroes do. Instead, the GM creates several leads with connecting clues. GM must determine the following for each lead.

#### Situation
What brings the characters to the lead, and what is the lead in the story? A stray matchbook could be a lead, as could an anonymous email that at first glance, seems to be full of gibberish. A combat encounter could also constitute a lead.

Unlocking Method
What unveils the clue and the next lead? The following options are available.
- Automatic: Just showing up, finding the object, or otherwise doing what’s necessary brings forth the clue. The GM can tell you based on your prior knowledge or common sense. An NPC might be willing to spill the beans.
- Having the Focus: Like the automatic method, no roll is needed, but the character examining the lead must have one or more specific focuses. Noticing that a gunman never intended to hit his target might be automatic for anyone examining bullet holes or a video of the firefight, as long as they possess an Firearms focus in any the type of firearms. A character with the Craft (Art) focus might notice an obvious forgery.
- Skill Test: Commonly, unlocking a lead requires an ability test. This is often an Investigate, Charm, or Notice test, but any skill might be useful. 

#### Clue and Next Lead
Determine the payoff of the new clue and next lead. The clue is simply information. The GM tells you what the unlocked lead means. The GM should not just provide information based on the lead itself, but add whatever the hero’s previous knowledge and common sense would bring forth. The solved lead also points toward a new lead, until you’ve uncovered enough clues to prompt the full reveal.

### The Reveal

Once the GM decides you’ve unlocked enough leads and deciphered enough clues along the trail, they provide the reveal: the final truth about the subjects being investigated. The GM can simply inform you, or provide it through an NPC, discovered documents, and other story elements. Again, the GM draws on your prior knowledge and common sense. The reveal’s facts should be either scattered throughout the clues you’ve discovered, or the clues should bring you somewhere where it all comes to light.

The GM doesn’t always have to provide a moment for the reveal. You may discover it with the facts at hand. If the GM thinks it would be useful, they can inform you that you’ve figured everything out, and perhaps grant additional rewards to recognize your cleverness.
