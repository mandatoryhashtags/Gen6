### **Welcome to Stellar Odyssey: Humanity's Journey**

#### **Introduction**

Welcome to the 23rd century, where humanity has spread across the stars in **Stellar Odyssey: Humanity's Journey**. In this epic sci-fi adventure, you will explore a galaxy rich with mystery, conflict, and discovery. The remnants of ancient alien civilizations offer tantalizing glimpses into a long-lost past, but intelligent alien life has not been found. Instead, human factions, each with their own ambitions and cultures, dominate the galaxy.

#### **Setting Overview**

Humanity's expansion into the stars began in earnest after the discovery of Zero-Point Energy (ZPE) in the mid-21st century. This revolutionary energy source enabled faster-than-light travel via the Alcubierre Drive, making interstellar colonization a reality. As humanity spread to new worlds, they encountered remnants of ancient alien technology, hinting at the existence of a once-great civilization.

However, despite the vastness of space and the countless planets explored, no living intelligent alien species have been encountered. Alien life exists in the form of animals, insects, and space-borne creatures, but humanity remains alone in the galaxy. This isolation has shaped the dynamics of human civilization, leading to the rise of powerful factions vying for control and influence.

#### **Faster-Than-Light Travel (FTL)**

The primary method of FTL travel is the **Alcubierre Drive**, which creates a warp bubble allowing ships to travel vast distances quickly. This drive relies on Zero-Point Energy (ZPE), a nearly limitless energy source that has revolutionized human technology and interstellar travel.
