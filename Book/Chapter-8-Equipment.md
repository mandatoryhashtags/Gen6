### Chapter 8: Equipment

Welcome to the equipment chapter for Gen6, set in the 90s with the unique blend of the mundane and the mystical world of **Veilbound**. This chapter will cover essential gear, weapons, armor, services, awakened items, and vehicles to equip your characters for their adventures.

#### Economics
In the early 1990s setting of Veilbound, the economy is shaped by both mundane and supernatural influences. The US dollar (USD) remains the dominant currency in the global market, symbolizing stability and economic power. In the mundane world, the economy is experiencing growth fueled by technological advancements, a burgeoning internet, and consumer-driven markets. Inflation is relatively low, and employment rates are stable, reflecting a period of prosperity for many.

However, beneath the surface, the Awakened world operates on a parallel economy where rare artifacts, magical potions, and enchanted items hold immense value. Transactions in the Awakened community often involve bartering or the use of precious metals and rare materials. While the US dollar is still accepted, its value can fluctuate based on the availability of mystical resources and the shifting power dynamics between supernatural factions. This dual economy creates a complex financial landscape where both mundane and magical currencies coexist, often intersecting in shadowy markets and secret exchanges.
