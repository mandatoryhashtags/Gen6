# Powers


## Arcane Backgrounds
Start by choosing one of the Arcane Background Edges available in your campaign.
Five different types are presented in this
book: Gifted, Magic, or Psionics

Each type has the following entries:
- ARCANE SKILL: Each type of power has a
particular arcane skill listed in its description.
Take this skill and buy it just like any other
on the skill list. The attribute to which the
skill is linked is listed in parentheses beside
the skill itself.
- STARTING POWERS: The number of powers
a hero starts with at character creation.
Additional abilities may be learned with the
New Powers Edge. The player
and Game Master can decide if there’s a
narrative reason for this (a cleric is given a
revelation, a wizard finds an old spellbook)
or it’s simply an evolution of her abilities.
- POWER POINTS: The number of Power
Points the character starts with when she
chooses an Arcane Background. A hero
increases her Power Points by taking the
Power Points Edge.

### Arcane Background (Gifted) 
- ARCANE SKILL: Focus (Wis)
- STARTING POWERS: 1
- POWER POINTS: 15
The character has innate abilities that don’t
fit into the usual tropes of magic, miracles,
or psionics. Their powers may be low-level
super powers, divine gifts, or even alien
abilities, and are often very unusual or unique
for their setting

### Arcane Background (Magic) 
- ARCANE SKILL: Spellcasting (Int)
- STARTING POWERS: 3
- POWER POINTS: 10
Magicians range from powerful wizards to
vile cultists. They draw on raw supernatural
energy to fuel their eldritch fires. This energy
infuses the worlds in which they live, and is
drawn forth with gestures, words of power,
or ancient runes.

### Arcane Background (Psionics)
- ARCANE SKILL: Psionics (Int)
- STARTING POWERS: 3
- POWER POINTS: 10
Psionicists tap into their own mental energy
to manipulate matter, read minds, and far
more. Some are agents in the employ of a vast
government agency, while others are often on
the run from them! Some may have years of
training or they might have developed their
incredible powers in isolation

## Activation
A character activates a power by picking a
target within Range and making an arcane
skill roll. A roll less than 4 means the power
doesn’t activate. The caster spends one
Power Point regardless of any Edges such
as Channeling, unless the ability specifically
says it reduces the minimum cost to 0.
